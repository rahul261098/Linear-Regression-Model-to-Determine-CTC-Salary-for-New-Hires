# Linear Regression Model to Determine CTC/Salary for New Hires

## Project Overview
This project uses Python to build a linear regression model that predicts the CTC/Salary for new hires based on their past employment data. The goal is to provide a data-driven approach to salary determination, helping companies make informed hiring decisions.

## Project Details
- **Project Title**: Linear Regression Model to Determine CTC/Salary for New Hires
- **Description**: A Python-based model to predict CTC/Salary using historical employment data.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Duration**: September 2024


## Usage
Prepare your dataset in a CSV file with relevant features such as years of experience, previous salary, education level, etc.
Place the dataset in the project directory.
Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions:
python train_model.py

The script will output the predicted CTC/Salary for new hires based on the input data.
## Key Features
# Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
# Model Training: Using linear regression to train the model on historical employment data.
# Model Evaluation: Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
# Prediction: Making salary predictions for new hires based on the trained model.
